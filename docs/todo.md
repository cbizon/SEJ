# Ideas for expansion

## Compare mode

Suppose that you have your version running, and a new IET comes out - don't overwrite it, but do the comparisons and make a series of accept/deny click boxes?

## Add external people

For generating better project budget summaries, you want to see people outside the organization that are funded on the project.

## Add project details

Start / End dates, budget, PI

## Add employee details

Salaries would allow turning various percentages into dollars.  It would also improve project detail pages, because you could calculate burn rate.

## Better non-project handling

There are different types of non-project rows.  I'm not sure what they are, so the weren't carefully considered

## Project aggregation

Our projects are granular - sometimes they will be different years of the same project, or different codes for non-project work.  From a higher level view we want to aggregate some of these.  So we want a way to merge some projects and view at that level (even if the allocations need to be at the more granular level).

## Workflow

The input to this is based on what finance thinks.  We put in changes and later those changes are reflected in finance.  These changes are often in flight when the input is generated.  If we track our submitted changes (RASRs) we could sync our understanding and finance's understanding more accurately, and track which changes we make here are reflected in which rasr requests.

## PI Report

Show effort levels / burn rates across all projects for which a person is a PI.

## Concurrency

The tool is now just a local single user setup.  To make it more of a shared system would take some concurency hancling

## Security

Moving to a multi-user setup would also require at least authentication, and probably a more thoughtful look at the security.
